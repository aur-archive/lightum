  As from version 2.0 lightum now can control screen backlight as
  well as keyboard brightness.
  This is enabled by default and it will adjust both (backlight
  and keyboard brightness) automatically reading data from the ambient light
  sensor located in the iSight camera.

  If this behavior does not suit your need you can always edit
  config setting in ~/.config/lightum/lightum.conf
  Note that you will have to re-run lightum after upgrade in order to have
  an updated version of the config file.
